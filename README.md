## General info

As cycling enthusiast, I struggle with the problem that sometimes I cannot find a riding partner/s. Although there are planty of groups/chats on popular social media platforms, but in my opinion it's not the most efficient way to explore problem described above. That's why i decided to create an app that will allow users to create or find rides on all over the world.

## Technologies

- React with Next framoweork and Typescipt
- Prisma and MongoDB for backend
- Tailwindcss
- Zustand for state menagement
